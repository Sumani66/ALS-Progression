# ALS-Progression
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression with PROACT


Name of the Dataset: Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PROACT)

Description:
The PROACT dataset is the largest publicly available clinical dataset for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research. It compiles de-identified patient data from multiple ALS clinical trials, including demographic details, clinical assessments, vital signs, laboratory test results, and survival information. The dataset is extensively used for ALS progression modeling, prognosis prediction, and biomarker identification.

Dataset Overview:

Classes: Continuous (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised [ALSFRS-R] scores over time)

Total Number of Patients: ~11,000

Train set size: Varies depending on study split

Validation set size: Varies depending on study split

Test set size: Varies depending on study split

Feature Categories:

Demographic Information: Age, gender, ethnicity

Clinical Assessments: ALSFRS-R scores, disease duration, forced vital capacity (FVC)

Laboratory Test Results: Blood biomarkers, respiratory function tests

Medication History: Riluzole usage, experimental treatments

Survival Data: Time-to-event analysis, censoring information
